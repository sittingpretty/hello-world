      No one was entirely certain how it had all begun.  One day everything was as it had always been and the next, every home in the vicinity, from great to small, was endowed with a tiny behatted porcelain man.  Meryton and Longbourn both contained an appreciable number of folk who practiced the old ways and were cautious - since they knew not of the creaturesâ€™ natures - to leave small gifts of food and herbs in front of these figures as peace offerings. Others, notably several of the major landholders from the surrounding area, disregarded the diminutive statues or carelessly shunted them aside. 

    People were starting to tell tales of laughing in odd places in their houses:  under the floorboards, inside of their chest of drawers, in spaces too small for anything human to climb.  They began to plant weapons near their beds; not that anyone believed in evil spirits, but just a precaution, for who could know what lurked in the darkness.
