        <h3>The Road Not Taken <br>by Robert Burns</h3><hr>
        <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
            And sorry I could not travel both<br>
            And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
            And looked down one as far as I could<br>
            To where it bent in the undergrowth;
            <br><br>
            Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
            And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
            Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
            Though as for that the passing there<br>
            Had worn them really about the same,<br>
            <br><br>
            And both that morning equally lay<br>
            In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
            Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
            Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
            I doubted if I should ever come back.
            <br><br>
            I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
            Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>
            I took the one less traveled by,<br>
            And that has made all the difference.</p>

            <h3>I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud <br>by William Wordsworth</h3><hr>
            <p>I wandered lonely as a cloud<br>
                That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br>
                When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
                A host, of golden daffodils;<br>
                Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
                Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br>
                <br><br>
                Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
                And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
                They stretched in never-ending line<br>
                Along the margin of a bay:<br>
                Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
                Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br>
                <br><br>
                The waves beside them danced; but they<br>
                Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
                A poet could not but be gay,<br>
                In such a jocund company:<br>
                I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
                What wealth the show to me had brought:<br>
                <br><br>
                For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
                In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
                They flash upon that inward eye<br>
                Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
                And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
                And dances with the daffodils.</p>

            <h3>The World Is Too Much With Us <br>by William Wordsworth</h3><hr>
            <p>The world is too much with us; late and soon,<br>
                Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—<br>
                Little we see in Nature that is ours;<br>
                We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!<br>
                This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;<br>
                The winds that will be howling at all hours,<br>
                And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;<br>
                For this, for everything, we are out of tune;<br>
                It moves us not. Great G-d! I&#39d rather be<br>
                A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;<br>
                So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,<br>
                Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;<br>
                Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;<br>
                Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.</p>
